        <h2>As a Web-Developer</h2>
        <p>
          In my journey as a web developer, I started by learning HTML and CSS,
          which provided me with the essential building blocks for creating
          static web pages and styling them to achieve a visually appealing
          design. With HTML, I learned how to structure and organize the content
          of a web page using semantic tags, allowing me to convey information
          effectively. CSS, on the other hand, empowered me to add colors,
          fonts, layouts, and other visual elements to create an attractive user
          interface. As I progressed in my learning, I realized that to take my
          web development skills to the next level, I needed to learn
          JavaScript. JavaScript intrigued me because it allowed me to bring my
          web pages to life by adding interactivity and dynamic functionality.
          I'm currently in the learning phase of JavaScript, where I'm exploring
          its syntax, concepts, and the various ways it can be used to enhance
          the user experience. By learning JavaScript, I can manipulate HTML
          elements on the page, handle user interactions such as clicks and
          input, and create dynamic content that adapts to user actions. I'm
          excited about the possibilities JavaScript offers, such as form
          validations, client-side data processing, and asynchronous requests to
          interact with servers. Through practical exercises and small projects,
          I'm gaining hands-on experience in applying JavaScript to real-world
          scenarios. I'm learning about functions, variables, conditional
          statements, loops, and objects, which form the building blocks of
          JavaScript programming. Understanding these concepts allows me to
          write scripts that respond to user events and make web pages
          interactive. As I continue my journey of learning JavaScript, I'm
          eager to explore more advanced topics, such as working with APIs,
          manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), and utilizing JavaScript
          frameworks and libraries like React or Vue.js. I believe that
          JavaScript will significantly enhance my web development skills and
          enable me to create dynamic and engaging web applications. Overall,
          I'm enthusiastic about my ongoing learning phase in JavaScript and how
          it complements my existing knowledge of HTML and CSS. I'm confident
          that mastering JavaScript will empower me to build more interactive
          and dynamic web experiences for users, opening up exciting
          opportunities in the ever-evolving field of web development.

        <h2>My journey in Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</h2>
        <p>
          In my journey as a web developer, I started by diving into the world
          of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML served as my gateway to
          creating web pages and understanding the foundational structure of the
          web. I was fascinated by the ability to mark up content and structure
          it using tags, elements, and attributes. As I delved deeper, I learned
          the importance of semantic HTML and its impact on both search engine
          optimization (SEO) and accessibility. I discovered the significance of
          using the correct tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and other
          content elements to ensure proper organization and readability.
          Learning HTML opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for me. I
          gained the ability to embed images, videos, and audio into web pages,
          enhancing the overall user experience. I learned how to create links
          that connect different web pages, facilitating seamless navigation for
          users. Moreover, I acquired knowledge about the importance of forms in
          gathering user input. Understanding form elements such as text fields,
          checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus enabled me to build
          interactive forms that collect data from users. Additionally, I became
          proficient in structuring data using HTML tables, making it easier to
          present information in a tabular format. I learned how to utilize CSS
          (Cascading Style Sheets) to enhance the visual design of HTML
          elements, enabling me to create visually appealing and aesthetically
          pleasing web pages. Throughout my HTML journey, I actively engaged in
          hands-on projects and practical exercises to reinforce my learning. By
          implementing responsive design principles, I ensured that my web pages
          adapt and display correctly across various devices and screen sizes.
          As I progress in my HTML journey, I'm excited to explore more advanced
          topics such as HTML5, which introduces new elements and attributes
          that enhance multimedia capabilities, geolocation, and semantic
          structuring. I also look forward to incorporating HTML best practices,
          optimizing website performance, and adhering to web standards.
          Overall, my journey in HTML has provided me with a strong foundation
          in web development. HTML has allowed me to express my creativity,
          build functional web pages, and communicate effectively through
          structured content. It continues to be an essential skill as I expand
          my knowledge and explore other web technologies to create captivating
          and user-friendly web experiences.

        <h2>Why i use Visual-Studio-Code for web-developement??</h2>
        <p>
          As a web developer, I have chosen Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my
          preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for web
          development. VS Code has become an indispensable tool in my workflow,
          providing a seamless and efficient environment for building websites
          and web applications. One of the reasons I opted for VS Code is its
          lightweight yet powerful nature. It strikes a perfect balance between
          simplicity and functionality. I appreciate how quickly it starts up,
